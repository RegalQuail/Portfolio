        <h2>Our AstroPi Project</h2>
        <p>
            Our idea for the Astro Pi 2022 experiment is to measure the average velocity 
            of an astronaut in the ISS. We are curious to see how fast the astronauts and 
            objects averagely moves from one spot to another in the station. To conduct our 
            experiment, we plan on using the AstroPi computer's ability to detect movement 
            and take pictures inside the station. The idea is to detect an astronaut's or 
            object's entry in the camera's field of view with the motion sensor, take a few 
            pictures, and write a script to analyze them and determine an average velocity of 
            both astronauts and objects. We plan on using the motion detector and the camera 
            of The Astro Pi Computer, which both point inside the station. When the motion 
            detector senses movement, it gives a signal to the camera to take several pictures 
            per second, and to stop when the motion is gone. The data we will be collecting is 
            a set of average velocity our program will have measured and calculated, as well as 
            a picture for each data collection which shows the data points. This experiment would 
            classify as a life in space experiment.
